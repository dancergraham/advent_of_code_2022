# Advent of Code 2022 🦀🐍

Rust and Python solutions to the problems at www.adventofcode.com 

I'm using this year's challenges to learn some more rust, 
switching to mostly python after the first week
to save my brain from melting.

I have started working my way through the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/),
refactoring my solutions to use features as I learn them.
